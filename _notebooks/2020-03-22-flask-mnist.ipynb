    "On this project I built a simple web application motivated by the repository [pytorch-flask-api-heroku](https://github.com/avinassh/pytorch-flask-api-heroku).   The project [pytorch-flask-api-heroku](https://github.com/avinassh/pytorch-flask-api-heroku) builds a web application for classifying images that can be uploaded via a web form. The web application is deployed in Heroku and uses a pre-trained model from PyTorch for the image classification.    \n",
